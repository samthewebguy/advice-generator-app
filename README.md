# Frontend Mentor - Advice Generator App Solution

This is my solution to the [Advice Generator App Challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/advice-generator-app-QdUG-13db) on Frontend Mentor.  
This challenge helped me improve my skills in working with APIs, handling asynchronous JavaScript, and creating clean, responsive layouts.

### What I Learned

This project helped me strengthen my understanding of working with APIs and updating the DOM dynamically using JavaScript.  

It also reinforced responsive design principles and handled user interactions smoothly.

Hereâ€™s a snippet of the function that fetches and displays new advice:

```js
function getAdvice() {
adviceText.textContent = "Loading advice...";
fetch ("https://api.adviceslip.com/advice")
.then (response => response.json ())
.then (data => {
    const advice = data.slip;
    adviceId.textContent = advice.id;
    adviceText.textContent = `"${advice.advice}"`;
})

.catch (error => {
    adviceText.textContent = "Oops! Couldn't load advice ðŸ˜¢";
    console.log ("Error fetching advice:", error);
});

}

```
